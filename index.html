  <h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The Web, short for World Wide Web, is a system of interlinked documents and resources, accessed through the internet, that are identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and can be accessed via a web browser. It is a way of accessing and sharing information over the internet.</p>

  <h3>What is the difference between INTERNET and WEB?</h3></p>
    
    <p>The Internet is the underlying network infrastructure that allows devices to communicate with each other, while the Web is the collection of websites and web pages that are accessed using a web browser over the Internet. While the Web is one of the most popular applications of the Internet, there are many other applications that use the Internet, such as email, messaging, file sharing, online gaming, and more.

  <h3>The key to the Internet: Server and Client</h3> 
</p>
    <p>
    For the internet service, it requires more than 2 computers. Frist one is a client computer and the other on is a service. On the first computer, a user put some destination info which is a web address on a web browser. The web address is the server computer's name so the client computer requests to the server which has the web address. Then the server responds to the client computer. index.html file is in the server computer but the client computer can request to see the index.html file from the server. That is why we call "SERVER" and "CLIENT". There relationshiop is Buisness. Also we need to think about the meaning of "BROWSER". It is 둘러보는 사람.
