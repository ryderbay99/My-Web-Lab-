  <h2>CSS</h2>
<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language that is used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in markup languages such as HTML or XML. CSS allows developers to separate the presentation of a document from its content, making it easier to maintain and update the layout and design of a website.</p>
    <p>CSS works by specifying style rules for HTML elements. These rules include properties such as color, font, size, and spacing, among others. CSS allows you to apply styles to specific elements on a web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, and can be used to create layouts and visual effects such as borders, gradients, and animations.</p>
