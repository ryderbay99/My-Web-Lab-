    <h3>HTML Tags</h3>
  </p>
    <p>
    <strong>BR TAG</strong><br>
  BR TAG is used to create a line break between the first and second lines of the paragraph and it doesn't need a closing tag.
  </p>
    <p>
      <strong>LI TAG</strong><br>

    </p>
      <p>
        <strong>IMG TAG</strong><br>
The IMG TAG stands for the image tag. We can put some images on our web by using this tag. IMG TAG has attributes. It is important to note that the img tag must include the <strong>src</strong> attribute (it stands for source), as it specifies the location of the image file. Without the src attribute, the image will not be displayed on the web page.<br><strong>ex) src="file name or file location"</strong>
      </p> 
<p>
  The <strong>alt</strong> attribute(it stands for alternative) is important for accessibility, as it provides a text description of the image that can be read by screen readers or displayed in place of the image if it cannot be loaded.
</p>
<p>
  The img tag also supports several other attributes, including:
</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>width</strong> : Specifies the width of the image in pixels or as a percentage.</li>
    <li><strong>height</strong>: Specifies the height of the image in pixels or as a percentage.</li>
    <li><strong>title</strong>: Provides additional information about the image, which can be displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.</li>
    <li><strong>border</strong>: Specifies the width of a border around the image.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>A TAG</strong><br>
The A TAG is an HTML tag used to define a hyperlink, or a link to another web page or resource. The A tag is an inline element, which means it can be used within a line of text or other content. A stands for Anchor and its meaning is Hypertext.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this example, the <strong>href</strong> attribute specifies the URL of the web page or resource to link to, and the text "Click here to visit Example.com" is the visible text that the user will see and click on to follow the link.Its meaning is <strong>Hypertext Reference</strong>.
  </p>

    <li><strong>target</strong>: Specifies where to open the linked document, such as in a new window or tab.</li>
    <li><strong>rel</strong>: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document, such as whether it is a pre-fetch or a pre-render link.</li>
