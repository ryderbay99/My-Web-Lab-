  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is commonly used in web development. It is often abbreviated as "JS". JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means it is executed on the user's web browser rather than on the server.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is used primarily to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. With JavaScript, you can add effects such as animations, respond to user interactions such as button clicks and form submissions, and dynamically update the content of a web page without requiring a page reload. JavaScript can also be used for more complex tasks such as creating web applications, working with databases, and building games.</p>
